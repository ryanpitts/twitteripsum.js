Twitter Ipsum generates lorem ipsum placeholder text based on any Twitter user's latest tweets.

It requires jQuery. It also updates and mangles some pieces from Fredrik Bridell's Lorem Ipsum Generator (http://bridell.com/loremipsum/).

There are easy config options for:
* twitterUser: the Twitter username for your ipsum
* tweetCount: how far back in the timeline to go
* seedWords: the terms you want to be SURE are available in the ipsum
* seedWeight: greater than 1 gives seedWords a higher chance of appearing
* groupers: words that will stay attached to the term that follows them
* grafs: the number of paragraphs, and the words in each, for your ipsum

Twitter Ipsum expects that somewhere in your markup, you'll provide a <div id="ipsum"> or <textarea id="ipsum"> to dump text into. If you provide a container with id="tweet-it", it will also add a Twitter button with a random quote as text. There's a config option to sign those tweets with a "via @username."
